GUIDE - EXPL
You are stuck in a mapworld environment containing several rooms.
Your task is to explore this world and reach an escape room.
You are always given an image of the current room you are in.
I have an image of the Escape Room, this is an initial description of my image - The image shows a grand room with a high ceiling, ornate decorations on the walls and ceiling, and large windows. There is a very large, elaborate crystal chandelier hanging from the center of the ceiling. The floor appears to be marble with some kind of inlaid pattern. There are display cases or pedestals in the room, and sunlight is streaming in through the windows. The overall impression is one of a historical or opulent interior.

Based on my description and the image given, you now have three options

First Option - If you think that the description of my image matches the image you have, i.e. you are in the escape room
then respond with one word - ESCAPE.

Second Option - If you think you need more details from my image - respond in the following format
QUESTION: Ask details about the image I have to verify if we have the same image or not

Third Option - If you think you are in a different room than what I have, i.e we are seeing different images,
then you can make a move in following Directions - {west, north}. Respond in the following format
MOVE: direction - Here direction can be one of {north, south, east, west}


EXPL - GM
MOVE : NORTH

Now you made a move to this room, and you can either ESCAPE, ask me a QUESTION or MOVE in one of these directions
{west, south}
