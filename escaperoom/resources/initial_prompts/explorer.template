You are exploring MapWorld, a network consisting of various interconnected rooms. Your goal is to find and reach the TARGET ROOM.

I have the image of the TARGET ROOM, and here is its description:
$INITIAL_DESCRIPTION$

At each step, you will be shown an image of your current room.
Using the image you see and your memory of the TARGET ROOM description, you can choose one of the following three actions:

1) If the current room exactly matches the description of the TARGET ROOM, reply with exactly -
ESCAPE

2) If the current room appears similar to my description, but you need more information to confirm the match,
ask me a clarifying question comparing a detail from your current image - in this format
QUESTION: your question here

3) If the current room is definitely not the TARGET ROOM, choose a direction from the available directions: $DIRECTIONS$
reply strictly in this format:
MOVE: chosen direction

Do not include any additional explanations or text.
