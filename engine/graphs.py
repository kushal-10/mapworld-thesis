"""
M, N, N_ROOMS = A grid of MxN consisting of N_ROOMS.
Node - Defined as any grid point/cell in a given MxN grid.
Room - A node where a room has already been formed. 
Graph - A grid configuration of N_ROOMS of a particular TYPE (layout) with exactly 1 connected component 
        i.e. every room can be visited from every other room in a given Graph
        Here TYPE can be one of - {random, random cycle, tree, path, cycle, generalized star, ladder}
Map - A Graph with assigned room types and images from ADE 20K dataset.

All graph types can be formed by creating their nx counterparts, but the assignment to a Grid like structure
becomes more complex, so create each graph type here
